# HEstate-A-Real-Estate-Website
Project Description:  This repository houses a simple yet visually engaging front-end website built using React.js, enriched with smooth animations thanks to the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library. SCSS (Sassy CSS) was used for a clean and maintainable styling approach, while React Icons Library added a touch of elegance to the interface.
